Notes

A variety of machine learning paradigms have been applied to text classification, including rule induction [6], Naive Bayes [7], memory based learning [8], decision tree induction [9] and support vector machines [10].

Neural Networks Notes

Don't need recurrent networks or LSTMs to learn long-term dependencies of ingredients to cuisines.

Try to cut unique ingredients or those in too many. (Stop word trimming)
